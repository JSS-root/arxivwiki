if you want to make a simulation of Nature,you’d better make it quantum mechanical, and by golly it’s a wonderful problembecause it doesn’t look so easy."
Since there researchers devoted themselves to harness the power of quantum computing from nature. Shors algo, Vazirani-Bernstein algo.
This paper written by John Preskill on describe the history, achievement, the future of Quantum Computing after 40 years later
