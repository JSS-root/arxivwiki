## Main idea
* Take the Goemans-Williamson SDP solution to MaxCut
* Instead of actually solving the SDP, construct a solution vector to the SDP where $$v_i \cdot v_j$$ is always the same
* Apply hyperplane rounding

On high-girth graphs, this gives you a way to provably bound the *cut fraction*, not just the *approximation ratio*.

On large random graphs (or more precisely, as girth $\to \infty$), this approaches the Gaussian wave solution, cutting an edge fraction $$\frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{\pi \sqrt{D}}$$.

This is also a very simple algorithm to implement. Given a girth $$2k$$, you can either diagonalize a $$k \times k$$ matrix or use the approximate vector given in the paper. Then, you apply hyperplane rounding and you get your cut.
