## Main idea
* A more efficient way to model $$1/f$$ noise is proposed (compared to a sum of random telegraph fluctuators), by constructing the transition matrix from scratch


## Background
* $$1/f$$ noise is ubiquitous, yet the origins are generally unknown
* $$1/f$$ (or in general $$1/f^\alpha$$) refers to the scaling of the power spectrum at low frequency (and generally causes slow drifts in control signals)
* One way to model it is by a series of Random Telegraph Noise (RTN) fluctuators; a collection of noise variables that oscillate between two values
* With enough RTN fluctuators oscillating between approprately chosen frequencies, the spectrum indeed scales like $$1/f$$ (in the limit)
* Solving the associated equations exactly however (to get the mean effect of the noise) quickly becomes prohibitive, since the number of noise states scales as $$2^N$$, for $$N$$ oscillators


## Results
* In this work, they propose to model $$1/f$$ by constructing a transition matrix describing transitions between noise states "by hand"
* The general idea is that the tranition matrix must satisfy certain properties to give a $$1/f$$ spectrum, which can be reverse engineered
* They argue that a size $$M$$ transition matrix constructed this way is equivalent to a system of $$M$$ RTN souces (which consists of $$2^M$$ noise states and an exponentially larger transition matrix), and therefore there is an exponential improvement
* This improvement stems from the observation that the constructed transition matrix is in some sense a more dense representation, and can represent more noise states, compared to an equivalent sized transition matrix arising from the RTN sources
