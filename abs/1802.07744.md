A sub-theory is a subset of operations, closed under joint measurements.

Main idea: If a sub-theory is contextual, it needs $$O(n^2)$$ space to be classically simulated (vs $$O(n)$$ for some noncontextual sub-theories, such as qubit stabilizer codes.) This quadratic scaling matches the Gottesman-Knill algorithm.

##### Things to clarify:

* Where else does contextuality imply simulation hardness?
* What about operations that are not closed?
