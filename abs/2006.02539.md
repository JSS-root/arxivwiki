## Main idea
* Using the permutation matrix representation (PMR) of a time-independent Hamiltonian $$H = D_0 +\sum_i D_i P_i $$ for diagonals $$D_i$$ and permutation matrices $$P_i\vert z \rangle = \vert z'\rangle$$, an algorithm to simulate the unitary evolution $$e^{i H t}$$ is given, by expanding as a Taylor series in the number of permutations, and using LCU.  


## Background
* The PMR method was originally developed for QMC by expanding the partition function $$\mathrm{Tr}e^{-\beta H}$$ (see e.g. [arXiv:1908.03740](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03740))
* Here the same general technique is employed by for the unitary operator $$U(t) = e^{-i H t}$$, where the expansion is in $$q$$, the number of permutations, e.g. $$\prod_{i=1}^q P_{i_k}$$
* The Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU) method ([arXiv:1202.5822](https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.5822)) is used to simulate an operator $$A = \sum_i \alpha_i U_i$$ probabilistically (though amplitude amplification can often be employed to boost the success)

## Results
* The expansion decomposes *exactly* into a product of unitaries $$U = U_{od}e^{-i D_0  t}$$, where $$U_{od}$$ is the off-diagonal contribution
* The unitary $$U_{od}$$ can be written itself as a sum of unitaries and simulated by the LCU method, where the sum is eventually truncated to order $$q=Q$$ with calculable error $$Q = O\left( \log (T/\epsilon) / \log \log T/\epsilon \right)$$ for evolution time $$T$$ to error $$\epsilon$$ (n.b. the simulation is actually done as a product of short-time evolutions) 
* Circuit description is given for the LCU simulation and how to use oblivous amplitude amplification to increase the success probability to arbitrary accuracy
* The overall claim is that this outperforms standard LCU methods where $$H = \sum_i \alpha_i U_i$$ since the construction here "is generally considerably more compact", resulting in fewer terms in the LCU circuit (examples of this are given in Table 3)
* The remaining diagonal terms are simulated directly via $$e^{-i D_0 \Delta t}$$ with fixed cost $$O(C_{D_0} )$$ where $$C_{D_0}$$ is the cost to evaluate a matrix element of $$D_0$$ (see after Eq. (12))
* Comparing to the standard LCU prescription for qubit systems, an example with an $$O(N^2)$$ reduction in the number of unitaries is given
