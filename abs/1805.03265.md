## Notes on low-depth QAOA (Chapter 5 and Appendix E)
* studies "QUBO" (quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems)
  * can create QAOA_p state for QUBO on n variables using n qubits and O(pn^2) gates
* studies MaxCut (instance of QUBO)
  * depth-1 on triangle-free graphs (cut fraction $$0.5 + \Omega(1/\sqrt{D}$$)
  * depth-1 in general
  * depth-2 on the ring
* "Pauli Solver" algorithm:
  * evolve observable, not state (observable is local, so easier to work with)
  * decompose into Pauli operators
  * discard terms with extra Zs or Ys (will be cancelled by initial state)
  * This approach is also used [in this paper](https://arxiv.wiki/abs/2101.05513)
  * It gets harder to do with more terms!
 * brief studies on weighted maximum cut and directed maximum cut
