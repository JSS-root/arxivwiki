## Main idea
* A QMC algorithm is given by using the "permutation matrix representation" (PMR), which writes the Hamiltonian in two parts, a diagonal part and off-diagonal $$H=D_0 + \sum_i D_i P_i$$ where $$D_i$$ are diagonal, $$P_i$$ off-diagonal permutation matrices $$P_i \vert z\rangle =\vert z'\rangle $$ ($$z\neq z'$$).
* The partition function is expanded as a Taylor series, but rewritten as a sum over $$q$$, the number of permutations $$\prod_{i=1}^q P_i$$
* This gives a QMC algorithm which in principle works in all parameter ranges (from quantum to classical)


## Background
* Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithms write the partition function associated with a quantum Hamiltonian (i.e. one with non-zero off-diagonal components) as a sum of positive weights: $$Z = \mathrm{Tr} e^{-\beta H} = \sum_c W_c$$
* Sampling this system only requires one to propose configuration updates $$c\rightarrow c'$$, and if the weights are all non-negative $$W_c \ge 0$$, the transition probability is simply $$W_c/W_{c'}$$, and standard MC methods can be used (if any weight is negative, the so-called sign problem exists and standard methods can not be used)
* There are many QMC algorithms around, and most have limits under which they operate well (such as only at high temperature, or high or low transverse-field)
* The technique used here is perhaps most closely related to the SSE (stochastic series expansion) formulation of QMC, which also starts with a Taylor series for $$Z$$ and regroups terms so it is no longer a high temperature expansion
* This work builds directly on [arXiv:1701.01499](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01499) and [arXiv:1802.08333](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08333) which proposed splitting the Hamiltonian in a similar manner, but only using generic off-diagonal terms $$H = D_0 + \sum_i V_i$$


## Results
* The main contribution of this work over the previous is that it explicitly expands $$H$$ using permutation matrices, which offers new insight
* This gives a clean interpretation of the QMC configuration, as a sequence of permutations $$\vert z_0\rangle \rightarrow \vert z_1\rangle \rightarrow \dots $$, akin to what is present in the path-integral formulation (using imaginary time-slices)
* The update scheme can dynamically change the $$q$$ value (this parameter is similar to the number of time slices in the path-integral approach, which is usually fixed in that case)
* There is a central object called the exponent of divided differences present in the QMC weights, which has some nice properties
* Updates here can in general be costly $$O(q^2)$$ as one needs to calculate the exponent of divided differences, however local updates can be done in $$O(q)$$
* Several comparisons against the SSE are given, showing the PMR outperforming in all cases
* The emergence is the sign problem is discussed (nb. there is a follow up paper with more detail in [arXiv:2012.02022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02022))
