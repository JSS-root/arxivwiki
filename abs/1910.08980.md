## Main ideas
* NLTS conjecture -- no low energy trivial states (i.e. cannot compute simply), is true for a family of local hamiltonians with topological Z2 symmetry
* This means SDP outperforms QAOA at constant p for certain instances of MaxCut
* Proposes a nonlocal QAOA that improves on QAOA (Recursive QAOA), each recursion eliminates one variable from the cost function

The NLTS result uses a fact that shallow quantum circuits cannot assign non-negligible probability across bitstrings with large Hamming distances.

Recursive QAOA runs QAOA, then finds the best correlation $$\langle Z_i Z_j \rangle$$, and makes this a constraint in the Hamiltonian. Then recurses (with 1 fewer variable each time) until its small enough to solve via brute force.
