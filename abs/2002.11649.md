Main idea: new, optimization-based method to compute phase factors for QSP

Theme: Block encoding is a powerful technique!

##### Why QSP?

* Goal is to implement matrix polynomials with few ancilla qubits
* Useful for hamiltonian simulation n $$e^{-iAt}$$, eigenvalue filtering,  QLSP ($$A^{-1}$$), thermal state $$e^{-\beta A}$$

##### How does QSP work?

* Approximate with a polynomial function $$f(x)$$, then encode $$f(A)$$ exactly via block-encoding
* QSP uses adjustable phase factors, but it's hard to find phase factors given $$f(x)$$
* It involves an "iterate" matrix. Taking an initial $$A$$ as an LCU, then block encoding it, the eigenvalues of block encoding are related to $$A$$.
* QSP uses D iterates and D+1 rotations (with a phase factor for each of D+1 angles).(Similar to QAOA!)

##### What does this paper do?

* This presents a loss function, when optimized, finds the best angles to choose. (You need to guess well!)
* It uses the "Remez exchange algorithm" to reduce the approximations required.
* This work makes an insight about the decay of phase factors as related to the decay of Chebyshev polynomials.

##### Things to clarify

What's the relationship between the below approaches?

* QSVT
* HHL algorithm for matrix function f(A)
* LCU method
* QSP
* QAOA
* qubitization
