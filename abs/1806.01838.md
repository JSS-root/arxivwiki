I found [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox8NuI1ULCE) really helpful. It started simple and ramped up very quickly.

* Unifying perspective on quantum walks, amplitude amplification, phase estimation, Grover diffusion
* Quantum walks and repeated operators
* Take unitary U, but just look at the top part A
* But also you can make a singular value decomposition!
  * You can implement a function on the singular values on A!!
  * This is more general than a function on the eigenvalues (can be non-square)
  * A is arbitrary. It depends on the polynomial function you want to implement on the singular values! (just has to be an odd polynomial function)
* Low degree approximate polynomials is the key.
* Lots of other possibilities (QMA amplification)
