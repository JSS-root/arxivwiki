This is a cool protocol, "qDRIFT":

* Split up H into normalized $$H_j$$ with constants $$c_j$$
* Randomly use unitaries $$e^{itH_j}$$ with probability $$c_j / \sum c_j$$
* With enough gates, it will approximate $$e^{itH}$$ (wow!)

It's good compared to Trotter/Suzuki since dependence on number of terms is much better (not directly on L, just on $$\sum c_j$$)

Stochastically drifts towards target unitary.

There is an interesting quantum channel argument, showing that the Taylor expansion of $$e^{itH}\rho e^{-itH}$$ is close to the probabilistic mixing of gates in qDRIFT (choosing $$H_j$$ with probability $$c_j/\sum c_j$$, many times)

##### New ideas

* Is there a higher-order qDRIFT?
* What about H = H_a + H_b, using qDRIFT on each one? (Perhaps we can partition the terms so that $$[H_a, H_b] \approx 0$$ ?
* What if you have one big $$\lambda$$ and a lot of little corrections? Can you run qDRIFT on the little corrections and make $$H_A + H_{qdrift}$$?

##### Things to clarify

* What is "compilation"?
* Why does qdrift perform so much better than trotter? even numerically?
* How does this compare to time dependent perturbation theory?
