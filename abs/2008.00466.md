This looks at the Ising model as a universal model for spin physics. MaxCut is a natural problem (mapping to the Ising model without overhead). They look at $$k$$-regular unweighted MaxCut.

How do you know which instances of a problem class are hard or easy?

Mobius ladder is the easiest type of problem, then cyclic and complete graphs, all the way up to arbitrary 3-regular MaxCut.

They do a numerical study to investigate the "hardness" of intermediate graphs: randomly generate instances, sometimes rewire edges, solve with Gurobi. I personally don't find this approach that inspiring, but Gurobi is a good proxy for "practically hard".

For circulant graphs, the hardness (to solve with Gurobi) corresponds with the instance's distance to the phase transition value.  They observe this as a "large optimality gap".

They propose a "simplicity criterion": The ground state minimizer is in the same direction as the eigenvector of the coupling matrix (i.e. the maximal eigenvector is also the correct solution). This makes the locally optimal solution the optimal solution. Although this works, I think this criterion is extremely restrictive and hard to intuit when it's true.
