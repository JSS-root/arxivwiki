## Main point

Studies r-spin Ising magnet $$(\sum_{i=1}^N \sigma_i^z)^r$$ with external $$\sigma_x$$ magnetic field.

Although there are barriers with quantum annealing (very rough energy landscape), the QAOA_p can do well when p is above a critical value $$\approx N/2$$ (because all the minima are degenerate).
When p is below the threshold, you have to choose the parameters well to easily find the ground state.

## Results

* p=1 QAOA can solve all r Ising magnet with h=0 and N odd (p=2 if N even)
  * This was known for r=2 Ising magnet (i.e. this is maxcut on a complete graph)
  * for odd r, $$\beta=\gamma=\pi/4$$ is the answer; for even r, $$\gamma$$ depends on $$\beta$$

Then QAOA (including the variational parameter search) is simulated to estimate the time needed to converge.
