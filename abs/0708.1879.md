qRAM: Typically we think of quantum computers as applying unitary gates to qubits and then measuring them. However, there are models of quantum computation that utilize adaptive measurements on highly entangled states. These models include teleportation-based quantum computing and one-way quantum computing. Stealth startup PsiQuantum is the one-way model, for example, in their implementation of photonic quantum computers.
