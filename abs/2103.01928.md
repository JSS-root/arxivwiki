## Motivation

* Analysis and classification ("physical" error generators) of small Markovian gate errors:
  * Hamiltonian
  * Stochastic Pauli
  * Stochastic correlation
  * Active

In real hardware, some of these errors are more important than others (i.e. some are negligible).

## Open quantum systems

* system interacts with "environment" 
* von neumann equations & kraus operators
* can "trace out" environment to understand system

## "Markovian" Gate errors
* They define it as "describable" by some map that does not depend on any "context" variable
* This makes the gate with error linear and CPTP (a process matrix)
