## Overview
* Objectives of Quantum Computation (At time paper was published)
  1. Perform robust quantum computation
  2. Develop new quantum algorithms, for which no equivalent classical algorithms exist
* One such approach to fulfill objectives: **Topological Quantum Computing**
  * Deal with 2D many-body systems wherein quasiparticles, called anyons, exhibit "exotic statistics."
  * Anyons arise due to localized excitations of constituent particles in many-body system
  * Distinct from bosons and fermions in their exchange statistics:
    * Bosons gain +1 phase upon exchange
    * Fermions gain -1 phase upon exchange (Informs Pauli-Exclusion Principle)
    * Anyons gain arbitrary phase factor (Abelian anyon) or unitary evolution (non-Abelian anyon) upon exchange
      * Result of restriction to 2 spatial dimensions, as opposed to the 3 in which bosons and fermions are found.
  * Braiding of anyon exchange paths in 2 + 1 dimensions (space + time) can be mapped to quantum gates to perform quantum computation.
    * States of anyons are protected from local measurements due to indistinguishability of degenerate states. Makes quantum computation more robust and fault-  tolerant.
