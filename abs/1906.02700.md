This is an experimental demonstration of QAOA.

For this specific problem, QAOA needs to run for approximately the same time regardless of the system size and (runtime independent from the qubit number) and with similarly good performance at the critical point of the Hamiltonian (where entanglement is maximized).

It’s easy to compute the ground state of this model classically for up to 100  qubits, but we didn’t know how to get the optimal parameters to get to the solution with QAOA. You would need to implement experimentally more complex Hamiltonians/unitary evolutions to make theoretical predictions on models you don’t know how to solve classically.

I am giving a talk to this conference (https://aqc2021.org/) and will be presenting also this work, among others.
