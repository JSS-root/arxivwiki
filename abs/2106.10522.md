40 years ago, Richard Feynman said:
"Nature isn’t classical, dammit, and if you want to make a simulation of Nature, you’d better make it quantum mechanical, and by golly it’s a wonderful problem because it doesn’t look so easy."

Since then researchers devoted themselves to harness the power of quantum computing. This paper describes the history, achievement, the future of Quantum Computing 40 years after Feynman.
