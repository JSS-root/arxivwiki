This is a more sophisticated theory of trotter error bounds for product formulas.

It makes these contributions:

1. defining types of trotter error (additive vs multiplicative vs exponential)
2. defining order conditions (rates of convergence of the errors)
3. using "error representations" (to prove bounds on errors)

Order conditions imply that many derivatives vanish: $$f(t) = O(t^p)$$ means first $$p$$ terms vanish (Since $$f$$ is smaller than $$ct^p$$ near 0, $$f = a_k t^k + ... + a_p t^p$$ ). This causes many terms to drop out.

##### Things to clarify

* What improvements did Su & Childs make before this?
* Eq 10 was tricky -- how do you get the R(t) part?
* Lemma 2: proof isn't clear to me: $$A + e^{-At_2}Be^{At_2} = H$$? Maybe the exponentials are constants?
* How is corollary 5 proved?
* pth order condition seems pretty crucial!
* How do you get eq 30?
