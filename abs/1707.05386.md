## main point

local algorithms cannot find maximal cuts on high-degree k-uniform hypergraphs (even when $$k \ge 4$$).

this is related to the overlap gap property -- the chance of neighboring cut edges will likely be very large or very small, but not in between.

this is in contrast to regular graphs (k=2), when the overlap gap property shouldn't hold.
