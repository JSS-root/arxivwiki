Main idea: There is a problem that 1D noiseless, 3D noisy constant depth quantum circuits solve but classical circuits need non-constant depth to solve.

The 1D problem uses the [magic square game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_pseudo-telepathy#The_Mermin%E2%80%93Peres_magic_square_game) on 2 sets of $$n$$ qubit pairs where qubit pair $$j$$ from set 1 and $$k$$ from set 2 are inputs. The classical constant-depth circuit cannot achieve much above 8/9 chance of success.
