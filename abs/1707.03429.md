The paper describes a quantum assembly language (QASM) called OpenQASM that is used to implement experiments with low depth quantum circuits.
Quantum programming can be done simply in hand-note or in IBM Quantum experiences.
It can also be implemented in for other platform like IonQ, Rigetti for quantum programming.
