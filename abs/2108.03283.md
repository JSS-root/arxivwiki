### FAQ
> * what results are numerical vs analytic?

- Everything up to section 8 is analytic. In section 8 we describe how we numerically compute the circuit transformations that we discussed.

> * are there extensions where this technique may work beyond free fremions?

- Thatâ€™s a very good question and is something we plan to study further in the future

> * do you hope to implement this on a NISQ device soon?

- yes, we already did. We have a second paper on this work which is less focussed on the numerics and more on the physics, see: https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03282 Figure 6 of that paper reports on results from a NISQ experiment performed with the compressed circuits, Fig. 11 of 2108.03283 gives the numerical error in Frobenius norm on these compressed circuits
