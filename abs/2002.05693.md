Noncontextuality is a generalization of classical-ness.

Noncontextuality implies a hidden variable theory can explain the results of measurements

If everything has to commute or anticommute (as in with Pauli measurements), then it is easy to simulate quasi-quantized, "noncontextual" Pauli Hamiltonians! So one can simulate more than just the diagonal terms.
