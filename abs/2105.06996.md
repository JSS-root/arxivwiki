## Notes from Stuart:

* paper focuses on original QAOA -- exact parameter series expressions via "the Heisenberg picture"
* vary mixing operator and initial state
* series approximations and leading-order behavior for arbitrary cost functions

## Which tools can we use to analyze QAOA?

* Use commutators to get a series from the superoperator; then truncate series.
* many terms will be zero, or bound terms
* use lightcones to ignore many terms
* look at "cost divergence" -- the average change of the cost over bit flips
* use "cost gradient" operators from action on basis states

## what do we get?

* general C, QAOA1 has performance formulas to third order using cost divergence
* qaoa beats random guessing (if you can bound the higher-order terms)
* qaoa behaves like simple classical random coin flipping algorithm for sufficiently small angles
